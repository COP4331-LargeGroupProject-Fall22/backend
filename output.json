[{"id":749013,"name":"Pasta","cuisines":[],"diets":[],"type":"main course,","instruction":{"instructions":"Cook the pancetta in a large Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the fat has rendered and the pancetta is crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the pancetta to paper towels to drain, reserving the fat in the pot. Add the onion, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and a couple pinches of salt to the pot and saute, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Deglaze the pot with the wine and bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Add the chicken stock, beans, tomatoes and 1 cup water to the pot. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 30 minutes. Puree the soup with an immersion blender, about 30 seconds, keeping at least half of the beans intact (or puree in a regular blender, then return to the pot). Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 12 minutes. Stir in the pancetta and half each of the parmesan and basil. Adjust the seasoning, if necessary, and garnish with the remaining parmesan and basil. Serve with Soppressata Sandwiches. Split open and quarter 1 baguette. Layer thick slices of sharp provolone and thinly sliced soppressata on the bread. Add some baby arugula and drizzle with sweet Italian vinaigrette.

I don't bother to beat them before adding them to the flour, but if you prefer to, do. Just find the way that you prefer. All you do is mix the flour and eggs together, and then knead the mixture until it comes together in a satiny mass. Kneading involves no more than pushing the mixture away from you with the heels of your hands and then bringing it back toward you. If you've got an electric mixer with a dough hook, then use that, though for some reason I don't find it makes the pasta cohere any sooner. And you don't get the relaxing satisfaction of making it by hand. When the pasta is silky smooth, form it into a ball, cover with a cloth and leave for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Then get out your pasta machine, read the instructions and away you go. Two tips first: cut each slice you want to feed through the pasta machine, read the instructions and away you go. Put through the no. 1 press quite a few times, folding the strip in 1/2 and pushing it through again after each time. When the pasta dough's been fed a few times through the no. 1 slot, pass it through the remaining numbers on the gauge before pushing it through the tagliatelle-cutters. And I find that pasta strips cut into tagliatelle is better if you leave them hanging over the table or wherever to dry a little first (10 minutes is enough). When you cook the pasta, make sure you've got plenty of boiling, salted water and start tasting as soon as the water comes back to the boil after you've put the pasta in. Use about 1/3 of the Meatballs in their sauce to toss with the cooked, drained pasta and then pour the rest of them over the scantly sauced ribbons in the bowl. This is ambrosia: food to get you through the winter happily. Just put everything in a large bowl and then, using your hands, mix to combine before shaping into small balls. Place the meatballs on baking sheets or plates that you have lined with plastic wrap, and put in the refrigerator as you finish them. Put the onion, garlic and oregano into the processor and blitz to a pulp. Heat the butter and oil in a deep, wide pan, then scrape the onion-garlic mix into it and cook over low to medium heat for about 10 minutes. Don't let the mixture stick, just let it become soft. Add the tomatoes and then add about 3/4 cup cold water to the pan with a pinch of sugar and some salt and pepper, and cook for about 10 minutes. The tomato sauce may appear thin at this stage, but don't worry, as it will thicken a little later. Stir in the milk, and then drop the meatballs in 1 at a time. Don't stir the pan until the meatballs have turned from pink to brown, as you don't want to break them up. Cook everything for about 20 minutes, with the lid only partially covering it. At the end of cooking time, check the seasoning, as you may want more salt and a grind or 2 more of pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"dough","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":10118334,"name":"pasta dough","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":10220409,"name":"tagliatelle","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":10110219,"name":"meatballs","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":14412,"name":"water","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":10018364,"name":"wrap","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11549,"name":"tomato sauce","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1042027,"name":"seasoning","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","category":"","nutrients":[]}]},"instructionSteps":[{"instructions":"Either put the flour (with the salt) in a bowl and crack the eggs into it, or make a mound of flour on a worktop and add the eggs to that.

When cooking pasta you want to include enough salt so that the water “tastes like the ocean”. Add ziti or your preferred small-to-medium sized pasta to the boiling water. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-high, so that the water continues boiling but does not bubble over. Stir the pasta in intervals and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or according to package directions. The pasta should be al dente, or feel free to cook longer if you like a softer texture or are making a cold salad. Once cooked strain the pasta in a colander. For a cold salad, rinse the salad in fresh water or drizzle some oil on them and mix gently – to prevent the pasta from sticking. Making mayo dressing Take the mayonnaise, extra virgin olive oil, dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, ground black pepper, sweet paprika, sugar and salt as per taste in a mixing bowl. Mix very well. Check the taste of the dressing and feel free to add more seasonings to suit your taste. You can add more sugar too. Making pasta salad Add the cooked pasta. Add in the chopped veggies – onions, capsicum, carrots. Add the finely chopped celery, parsley and sliced olives if using. Toss and combine well so that the pasta and veggies are coated with the mayo dressing. Garnish with parsley and serve right away while warm, or allow the pasta salad to cool before storing in the fridge to chill and enjoy cold. Serving suggestions Serve pasta salad as a main dish with your preferred Italian-inspired sides. For a lighter meal serve with fresh vegetables – cucumber, radish, carrots or greens – like spinach or kale, either as a raw salad or steamed. Pasta salad is great for brunch or an afternoon lunch, or even as a hearty snack between meals.","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":14412,"name":"water","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11520420,"name":"ziti","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":4025,"name":"mayonnaise","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1034053,"name":"extra virgin olive oil","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1002030,"name":"ground black pepper","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1022068,"name":"red wine vinegar","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1032046,"name":"dijon mustard","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1002028,"name":"sweet paprika","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":1042027,"name":"seasoning","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":20421,"name":"cooked pasta","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":10211821,"name":"bell pepper","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11297,"name":"parsley","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11143,"name":"celery","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":9195,"name":"olives","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11583,"name":"vegetable","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11206,"name":"cucumber","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":10011457,"name":"spinach","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":21052,"name":"greens","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11429,"name":"radish","category":"","nutrients":[]},{"id":11233,"name":"kale","category":"","nutrients":[]}]},"instructionSteps":[{"instructions":"Cooking pasta","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","category":"","nutrients":[]}]},{"instructions":"Bring heavily salted water to a boil in a large pot on high heat.
